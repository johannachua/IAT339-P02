        Matthew Fong is a user experience and user interface designer situated in the Vancouver, Canada area. His passion lies in user research.

As someone who enjoys personal understanding and reflection, user research allows him not only to exert empathy and learn about individuals, but to learn more about himself in the process. As a third culture child, Matthew strive to gain a better understanding of him as both ethnically Chinese and a culturally Canadian citizen and how he fits in Western society while being a designer.
